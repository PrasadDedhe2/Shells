Basics: Powershell treats input and output both as objects. 

Where-Object, ForEach-Object, Select-Object are three most imp things for traversal in an object

@{key:value,Key1:value1} --> Dictionary/hash table defination



Get-Command
Get-Help
Get-Process
Write-Host ---> Print command
Checkpoint-Computer ---> Creates a restore point for a computer to avoid data loss
The Select-Object cmdlet selects the specified properties of a single object or group of objects
Set-Alias ---> Creates or changes an alias for a cmdlet or other command in the current PowerShell session.
-Jobs need to understand this

Invoke-TroubleshootingPack (Get-TroubleshootingPack C:\Windows\diagnostics\system\{press tab here}) ---> This will fix any basic issue if system is facing

Measure-Command Shows the time taken by the script to run
Measure-Object shows the size of the output object
{} ---> Use to do nested commad
| ---> Use to further process the output object for previous command

Start-Job ---> Use this command to run a locally situted script

New-Item or Remove-Item can be used to create or delete files
Get-Content shows us the content of a file 

Get-Unique shows the exactly unique values in a list

Group-Objects ---> This command groups the files/objects as type.
ex. ForEach-Object {Get-Item -Path "C:\Users\HP\Desktop\GOALS\LTI\*"} | Group-Object -Property extension ----> This command will tell us that how many files in LTI folder are pdf,txt,png etc

In a script block that defines a script property or script method, the $This variable refers to the object that is being extended.
