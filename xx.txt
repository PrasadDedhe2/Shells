(Write a PowerShell script that performs the following tasks:
1. Retrieves a list of running processes on a Windows machine.
2. Filters the processes to display only those with high CPU utilization (e.g., above 80%).
3. Saves the list of high CPU utilization processes to a log file with the current date and time)

$sumOfAllCPUSeconds = Get-Process | Measure-Object -Property CPU -Sum # Getting sum of all working CPU
seconds
$AllProcess = Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property CPU | Select-Object -Last 5 # Getting All process details
#Remove-Item C:\Users\HP\Desktop\HighCPU.csv #Uncomment and replace with specific location to create the log
file
foreach ($process in $AllProcess) #looping through all Process to get the percentage
{
$individualCPU = $process.CPU
$date = Get-Date
$percentage = [math]::Round($individualCPU*100/$sumOfAllCPUSeconds.Sum,2)
